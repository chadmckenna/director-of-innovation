- Connecting AI to Financial Impact: It's crucial to relate AI discussions to financial statements, as board members want clarity on the financial implications of AI strategies (citation:5).

- Diplomacy and Expectation Management: The volatile nature of AI requires CIOs to set and reset expectations with their boards continually. This includes guiding boards on how they can effectively oversee AI developments (citation:5).
